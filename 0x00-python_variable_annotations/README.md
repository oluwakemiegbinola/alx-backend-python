Variable Annotations

Variable annotations in Python are a way to declare the types of variables explicitly. They were introduced in Python 3.6 as part of PEP 526. Variable annotations are optional and do not affect the actual runtime behavior of the code; they are primarily used for documentation, static analysis, and type checking purposes.

Variable annotations use the : syntax to indicate the type of the variable. Here's a basic example:

python
Copy code
x: int = 5
In this example, x is annotated as an integer. However, it's important to note that Python remains a dynamically typed language, so these annotations are not enforced by the interpreter at runtime. Instead, they provide hints to tools like type checkers (e.g., MyPy) and IDEs for static analysis and type inference.

Annotations can be used with any valid Python expression:

python
Copy code
name: str = "John"
age: int = 30
You can also annotate variables with more complex types, including custom classes and generics:

python
Copy code
from typing import List

numbers: List[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Annotations can also be used for function parameters and return types:

python
Copy code
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return "Hello, " + name
However, as of Python 3.9, variable annotations can't be used with assignment expressions (walrus operator :=).

Variable annotations are not restricted to just built-in types. You can use custom classes and types defined in modules from the typing module to specify more complex structures and relationships between variables.
